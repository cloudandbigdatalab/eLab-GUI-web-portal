#### Course 1: Horizon Dashboard Keystone as User #

* * *

The url for the dashboard is our gateway to our environment. This makes our interaction seem like a web application, which this is very much similar to that idea. The dashboard serves as a graphical interface for most functions within OpenStack. 

Keystone is the identity service in charge of providing authentication and authorization to access the openstack services. Horizon, which is the OpenStack dashboard project, it is a canonical representation that allows you to access the openstack services like Nova, Neutron, Swift, Keystone through a web based user interface. It allows the admin and other users to access and manage the functional components using just a web browser.

The Horizon dashboard supports 3 types of central dashboards. These are: 
* User Dashboard
* System Dashboard
* Settings Dashboard of all the core openstack projects

Using these, the core openstack projects are supported and delivered.

It has an Extensible feature as the user can customize the dashboard with new components that are related to the projects. 
The code base is simple, easy to navigate as every file is programmed  with the required logic and arranged in a modular manner such that the files are easily correlated with navigation, making it a lot Manageable.
There is Consistency across the application with respect to the visual paradigm and interaction paradigm by accessing a solid set of reusable templates, the required core classes on which the changes are made and also additional tools such as base widget classes, form classes, etc)
The Horizon Dashboard is also Stable. The use of core classes and reusable templates creates an implicit requirement that there has to be backward compatibility in case of a change.
